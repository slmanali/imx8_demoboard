# Code Documentation for `test_audio_control.cpp`

## Overview

The `test_audio_control.cpp` file contains a set of unit tests designed to verify the functionality of the `AudioControl` class. It uses assertions to check that the various audio control methods behave as expected under different conditions. The main function executes the tests and handles exceptions that may arise during the testing process.

## File Structure

```cpp
#include "Audio.h"
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
```
- **Includes**:
  - `"Audio.h"`: Header file that presumably contains the definition of the `AudioControl` class and its associated methods.
  - `<cassert>`: Standard library header for assert functionality.
  - `<iostream>`: Standard library header for input and output streams.

## Function Definitions

### `void testAudioControl()`

This function encapsulates the series of tests for the `AudioControl` class. It performs the following tests:

1. **Headphone Volume Control**:
    - Tests setting the volume level to different values and checks assertions to confirm expected outcomes.
  
2. **Line Output Volume Control**:
    - Similar to headphone volume, but checks the behavior for line output volume.

3. **Capture Input Volume Control**:
    - Tests the volume for capturing audio input with established boundaries.

4. **Capture Input Type**:
    - Tests switching between different input types (e.g. "ADC", "DMIC").

5. **Digital Playback Volume Control**:
    - Validates that digital playback volume can be set and retrieved correctly.

6. **Digital Capture Volume Control**:
    - Confirms that the digital capture volume settings are effective.

7. **Digital Playback Boost Volume Control**:
    - Tests the boost feature in digital playback volume.

8. **Digital Sidetone Volume Control**:
    - Verifies sidetone volume settings.

#### Sample Code for Headphone Volume Test

```cpp
std::cout << "Testing Headphone Volume...\n";
audioControl.setVolumeLevel(50);
int headphoneVol = audioControl.getVolumeLevel();
assert(headphoneVol == 50 && "Headphone volume mismatch");
audioControl.setVolumeLevel(0); // Test min
assert(audioControl.getVolumeLevel() == 0 && "Headphone min volume failed");
audioControl.setVolumeLevel(63); // Test max
assert(audioControl.getVolumeLevel() == 63 && "Headphone max volume failed");
```

### `int main()`

This function serves as the entry point of the program. It attempts to execute `testAudioControl()` and captures any exceptions thrown during the testing. If an exception occurs, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with a status code of 1. If all tests pass, the program exits with a status code of 0.

### Error Handling

The `main` function includes a try-catch block:
```cpp
try {
    testAudioControl();
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "Test failed: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    return 1;
}
```
- This ensures that any exceptions thrown during the execution of tests are caught and reported, allowing for easier debugging.

## Conclusion

The code in `test_audio_control.cpp` is a robust testing suite for the `AudioControl` class, checking various settings related to audio volume control and input types. It makes extensive use of assertions for validation and reports results and errors clearly to the user. Developers can extend this framework by adding additional test cases or modifying existing ones to cover more edge cases as the `AudioControl` class evolves.

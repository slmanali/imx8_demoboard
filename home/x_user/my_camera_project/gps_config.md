# Detailed Code Documentation for `gps_config.cpp`

## Overview
The `gps_config.cpp` file implements a class `GPSConfigurator` that manages the configuration of a GPS device via a serial port. The class is designed to open the serial port at a specified baud rate, send a series of configurations to the GPS device, and listen for responses from the device. The underlying library for serial communication and threading is Boost.Asio.

## Dependencies
This code utilizes several libraries:
- **C++ Standard Library**
  - `iostream`: For console input and output.
  - `vector`: For dynamic arrays.
  - `string`: For string manipulation.
  - `thread`, `atomic`, `mutex`, and `condition_variable`: For managing threads and synchronization.
  
- **Boost Libraries**
  - `boost/asio`: For asynchronous I/O operations.
  - `boost/asio/serial_port.hpp`: For serial port operations.
  - `boost/bind/bind.hpp`: For binding functions with parameters.

## Class: `GPSConfigurator`

### Constructor
```cpp
GPSConfigurator(const std::string& port_name)
```
#### Parameters
- `port_name`: A string representing the name of the serial port to communicate with the GPS device.

#### Constructor Functionality
- Initializes the serial port using Boost.Asio.
- Configures serial port settings to 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit (8N1).
- Sets up predefined GPS configuration commands to be sent to the device later.

### Destructor
```cpp
~GPSConfigurator()
```
#### Functionality
- Stops the background reception thread and waits for it to finish using `join`.
- Closes the serial port connection.

### Public Member Function
#### `void configure()`
Initiates the configuration process which includes:
- Setting the baud rate to 115200.
- Starting a thread to listen for responses from the GPS device.
- Sending configuration commands to the GPS device.

### Private Member Functions

#### `void set_speed()`
- Iteratively tries to set the baud rate of the serial port to multiple predefined values.
- For each baud rate, it sends a command to set the baud rate, waits for processing, and checks for valid NMEA data.
- Throws a runtime error if communication cannot be established.

#### `void start_receive_thread()`
- Launches a background thread that continuously reads data from the GPS device.
- It constructs complete lines of responses by reading characters until a newline character is detected.
- It processes any acknowledgments from the GPS device.

#### `void send_configurations()`
- Iterates through the predefined configuration commands and sends them over the serial port.
- Waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the GPS device for each command sent using a condition variable.

## Member Variables
- `io_service io`: An I/O service object to handle asynchronous operations.
- `serial_port port`: Represents the serial port for communication.
- `std::thread rx_thread`: Thread for receiving data from the GPS device.
- `std::atomic<bool> stop_receive`: A flag to indicate when the background thread should stop.
- `std::vector<std::string> configurations`: Stores the list of configuration commands to be sent.
- `std::vector<int> baudrates`: Contains the list of baud rates to be tested.
- `std::mutex mtx`: A mutex for protecting shared resources between threads.
- `std::condition_variable cv`: Used for waiting and notifying between threads.
- `std::atomic<bool> cmd_executed`: Indicates whether a configuration command was successfully executed.

## Main Function
```cpp
int main()
```
- The entry point of the program.
- It instantiates the `GPSConfigurator` class with the specified port name.
- Calls the `configure` method to initiate the GPS configuration.
- Handles any exceptions that may occur during the process, printing an error message and returning with an error code.

## Error Handling
The code contains various try-catch blocks to handle `boost::system::system_error`, which ensures robustness during serial port operations. Detailed error messages are output to the console for easier debugging.

## Remarks
- Ensure that the correct serial port name is supplied when instantiating `GPSConfigurator`.
- The command strings in `configurations` should conform to the GPS deviceâ€™s expected command format.
- The implementation assumes the presence of Boost libraries, which must be correctly installed and linked in the build environment for this code to compile and execute successfully.

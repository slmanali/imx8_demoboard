# Documentation for `wifi.json`

## Overview
The `wifi.json` file is a JSON-formatted document that contains configuration information for Wi-Fi network connections. It is structured as an array of objects, with each object representing a separate Wi-Fi network configuration. The document contains three key pieces of information for each Wi-Fi network: the SSID (Service Set Identifier), password, and URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) associated with the respective network.

## Structure
The `wifi.json` file follows a structured format that can be parsed by JSON-compatible programming languages. Below is the structure of the file:

```json
[
	{
		"password" : "string",
		"ssid" : "string",
		"uri" : "string"
	}
]
```

### Fields

#### 1. password (string)
- **Description**: This field contains the password required to connect to the Wi-Fi network. It must be entered in a valid format and should generally adhere to the security standards of the individual Wi-Fi access points.
- **Example**: `"30963501"`

#### 2. ssid (string)
- **Description**: The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of the Wi-Fi network that clients use to identify and connect to the network. The SSID should be unique within the environment.
- **Example**: `"TP-Link_71C0_5G"`

#### 3. uri (string)
- **Description**: This field represents the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) associated with the Wi-Fi network. It typically indicates the local IP address of the default gateway (usually the router) of the Wi-Fi network. The format should generally follow that of an IP address.
- **Example**: `"192.168.1.120"`

## Example of `wifi.json`
Here is a sample of what the `wifi.json` file looks like with network configuration data:

```json
[
	{
		"password": "30963501",
		"ssid": "TP-Link_71C0_5G",
		"uri": "192.168.1.120"
	}
]
```

## Usage
The `wifi.json` file can be used in various applications or systems that require configuration for Wi-Fi connectivity. To utilize the information:

1. **Loading the JSON File**: The application should read and parse the `wifi.json` file to extract the network configurations.
2. **Connecting to Wi-Fi**: Using the extracted SSID and password, the application can connect to the specified Wi-Fi network.
3. **Accessing Resources**: The URI can be used to refer to networked resources, such as devices connected to the same network.

## Security Notes
- **Password Security**: Ensure that the password stored in the `wifi.json` file is kept secure. Avoid committing this file to public repositories or exposing it in unsecured environments.
- **Sensitive Data**: The contents of the `wifi.json` file may contain sensitive data. Handle the file with care to prevent unauthorized access.

## Conclusion
The `wifi.json` file serves as a crucial component for managing Wi-Fi network configurations in software applications. Proper understanding and handling of the file structure will facilitate smooth network connectivity and ease the process of accessing network resources.

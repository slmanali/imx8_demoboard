# Code Documentation

## File: `main.cpp`

### Overview
This file serves as the entry point for a Qt application intended for a smart helmet project that utilizes camera functionalities. It initializes necessary libraries, sets up the environment for both Qt and GStreamer, and creates a full-screen viewer for camera output.

### Includes
- `<QApplication>`: Provides the core application functionality of the Qt framework.
- `<csignal>`: Necessary for handling asynchronous signals.
- `"camera_viewer.h"`: Header file that likely contains the definition for the `CameraViewer` class, which is responsible for displaying camera content.
- `<QSurfaceFormat>`: Facilitates the specification of surface format and rendering settings for OpenGL context.
- `<cstdlib>`: Utilized for environment variable management.
- `<gst/gst.h>`: This is part of the GStreamer library, which is used for handling multimedia content.

### Helper Functions

#### `setEnvIfDifferent(const char* var, const char* desired_value)`
This function checks the current value of an environment variable and updates it if it differs from the desired value.

**Parameters:**
- `const char* var`: The name of the environment variable to be checked/modified.
- `const char* desired_value`: The desired value to set for the environment variable.

**Functionality:**
1. Retrieves the current value of the specified environment variable using `getenv`.
2. If the variable is not set or if the current value differs from the desired value, it sets the variable using `setenv` and prints a debug message indicating the change.
3. If the variable is already set to the desired value, a message confirming this is printed.

**Example Usage:**
```cpp
setEnvIfDifferent("GST_PLUGIN_PATH", "/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/");
```

### Global Variables
- `volatile std::sig_atomic_t gSignalStatus`: This variable holds the status of the signal caught by the signal handler, indicating what type of signal was received.

### Signal Handling

#### `void signal_handler(int signal)`
This function serves as a custom signal handler that updates the global signal status and requests the Qt application to terminate.

**Parameters:**
- `int signal`: The signal number that has been raised.

**Functionality:**
- Assigns the received signal to the `gSignalStatus` variable.
- Calls `qApp->quit()` to terminate the Qt event loop gracefully.

### `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
The main function initializes the application, sets up the environment, and handles the execution flow.

**Parameters:**
- `int argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
- `char *argv[]`: The command-line arguments.

**Functionality:**
1. Initializes GStreamer by calling `gst_init`.
2. Redirects `stdout` and `stderr` to specific log files for logging purposes.
3. Calls `setEnvIfDifferent` multiple times to configure necessary environment variables for the application and GStreamer.
4. Sets up OpenGL surface format with core profile settings to ensure compatibility with the expected rendering contexts.
5. Initializes the Qt application by creating an instance of `QApplication`.
6. Logs application startup information.
7. Creates an instance of `CameraViewer`, sets it to full-screen mode, and starts the application's event loop using `app.exec()`.
8. Handles exceptions by logging an error message if an exception is thrown during application initialization, returning -1.

**Example of Starting the Application:**
```cpp
QApplication app(argc, argv);
CameraViewer viewer;
viewer.showFullScreen();
return app.exec();
```

### Exception Handling
The application includes structured exception handling to catch and log errors that might occur during the initialization phase, ensuring that any issues are reported via log files rather than causing the application to crash.

### Logging
Logging is performed with macros/functions (presumed to be defined elsewhere, as they are not part of standard libraries) such as `LOG_INFO` and `LOG_ERROR` for easier debugging and tracking of the application's flow and error management.

### Conclusion
The `main.cpp` file establishes the foundational components necessary for running a camera viewing application within a smart helmet context. It is designed to be robust, ensuring proper setup for key dependencies, signal handling for graceful termination, and comprehensive logging to facilitate debugging and application maintenance.

# Documentation for `vpn_start_script.sh`

## Overview
`vpn_start_script.sh` is a shell script used to start an OpenVPN client session with a specified configuration file. The script ensures that the OpenVPN configuration file contains the necessary directives for running the OpenVPN process as a non-privileged user. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the `user` and `group` directives set to `nobody` and `nogroup`, respectively, and adds them if they are missing. Once the necessary modifications are ensured, the script executes the OpenVPN command with the provided configuration file.

## Script Breakdown

### Shebang
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- This line indicates that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

### Echo Statement (Commented Out)
```bash
#echo "------- START VPN"
```
- This line is currently commented out and can be used for debugging purposes to display a message indicating that the VPN startup process is beginning.

### Variables
```bash
CONFIG_FILE=$1
```
- This line assigns the first argument passed to the script (`$1`) to the variable `CONFIG_FILE`. The argument should be the path to the OpenVPN configuration file that the user wants to use.

### Configuration File Checks and Modifications
```bash
grep -qxF 'user nobody' "$CONFIG_FILE" || echo 'user nobody' >> "$CONFIG_FILE"
grep -qxF 'group nogroup' "$CONFIG_FILE" || echo 'group nogroup' >> "$CONFIG_FILE"
```
- The first `grep` command checks the configuration file to see if it contains the line `user nobody`. The options used are:
  - `-q`: Quiet mode; does not output anything to stdout.
  - `-x`: Matches the whole line.
  - `-F`: Treats the pattern as a fixed string rather than a regular expression.

  If the line is not found (i.e., the command returns a non-zero exit status), it appends `user nobody` to the configuration file using `echo`.

- The second `grep` command functions similarly, checking for `group nogroup`. If this line is absent, it appends `group nogroup` to the end of the configuration file.

### Starting OpenVPN
```bash
openvpn --config "$CONFIG_FILE"
```
- This line invokes the OpenVPN client with the specified configuration file. The `--config` option tells OpenVPN to use the configuration file defined in the `CONFIG_FILE` variable.

## Usage
To use this script, you need to provide the path to your OpenVPN configuration file as an argument. Here's how to execute the script from the command line:

```bash
bash vpn_start_script.sh /path/to/your/config.ovpn
```

### Important Note
- Ensure that the script has executable permissions. You can make the script executable with the following command:
  ```bash
  chmod +x vpn_start_script.sh
  ```

## Requirements
- The script should be run on a Unix-like operating system with Bash installed.
- OpenVPN must be installed on the system and accessible in the user's PATH.
- The user executing this script should have appropriate permissions to modify the specified configuration file and to run OpenVPN.

## Conclusion
The `vpn_start_script.sh` serves as a simple automation tool to facilitate the initiation of OpenVPN connections while ensuring critical configuration options are correctly set. By checking and modifying the provided configuration file, the script helps maintain system security by running OpenVPN under a non-privileged user.

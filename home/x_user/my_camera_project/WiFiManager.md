# WiFiManager Documentation

## Overview

The `WiFiManager` class provides a comprehensive interface for managing WiFi connections and VPN operations on a system. It facilitates operations such as connecting to WiFi networks, VPN management, and network scanning. The class leverages system commands primarily through `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command Line Interface) and handles JSON configurations for managing multiple connection profiles.

## Includes

The following headers are included in this file:

- `<iostream>`: For input/output stream operations.
- `"Configuration.h"`: Custom header, likely defining the `Configuration` class for managing configuration settings.
- `"HTTPSession.h"`: Custom header, likely defining the `HTTPSession` class for handling HTTP requests and sessions.
- `<fstream>`: For file stream operations, useful in reading and writing configuration files.
- `<string>`: For string manipulation.
- `<memory>`: For smart pointer utilities.
- `<csignal>`: For signal handling support (not used in the shown code).
- `<vector>`: For dynamic arrays.
- `<algorithm>`: For algorithm utilities (not extensively used in the shown code).
- `<thread>`, `<chrono>`: For multi-threading functionalities and utilities.
- `<regex>`: For regular expression support, mostly for matching and validating strings.
- `<stdexcept>`: For exception handling.
- `<cstdio>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<cstring>`, `<sstream>`: For C-style I/O operations and string stream capabilities.
- `"Logger.h"`: Custom logger utility for logging messages at different severity levels.
- `<sys/wait.h>`, `<sys/types.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, `<fcntl.h>`: System calls and utilities from POSIX for process handling (like for managing VPN processes).
- `<jsoncpp/json/json.h>`: For handling JSON input/output operations.
- `<future>`: For asynchronous operations using promises and futures.

## Structures

### Connection

```cpp
struct Connection {
    std::string uri;
    std::string ssid;
    std::string password;

    Connection(const std::string& uri, const std::string& ssid, const std::string& password);
    Connection() = default;
};
```

The `Connection` struct encapsulates the credentials necessary for connecting to a WiFi network. 

**Members:**

- `uri`: A URI string that may indicate the endpoint after connection.
- `ssid`: The Service Set Identifier (SSID) of the WiFi network.
- `password`: The password for the WiFi network.

**Constructors:**

- `Connection(const std::string& uri, const std::string& ssid, const std::string& password)`: Initializes a new `Connection` with the provided SSID and password.
- `Connection()`: Default constructor.

## Class: WiFiManager

```cpp
class WiFiManager {
public:
    WiFiManager(const std::string& wireless_interface, Configuration& _config, HTTPSession& _session);
    void init();
    int run();
    void setConnections(const Json::Value& conn, bool _force_connection = false);
    void setForceConnection(bool force);
    void scan();
    void stopVpn();
    void updateVpnPerformance(const std::string& file_path);
    void sedVpn(const std::string& file_path);
    bool startVpn(const std::string& file_path);
    void vpnProcessListener(std::shared_ptr<std::promise<bool>> initPromise);
    void disable_wifi();
    void enable_wifi();
    int check_wifi(const int _max_attempts = 30);
private:
    // Members...
};
```

### Public Member Functions

- **Constructor:**
    ```cpp
    WiFiManager(const std::string& wireless_interface, Configuration& _config, HTTPSession& _session);
    ```
  Initializes an instance of `WiFiManager` with the specified wireless interface and configurations.

- **void init()**:
  Resets internal state variables to their initial values, preparing the manager for a new run.

- **int run()**:
  Main execution method that checks connection state and initiates connection procedures as needed. Returns an integer status code based on the outcome.

- **void setConnections(const Json::Value& conn, bool _force_connection = false)**:
  Sets up a vector of `Connection` objects from a JSON input. If `_force_connection` is true, it attempts to connect immediately.

- **void setForceConnection(bool force)**:
  A setter method for the `force_connection` variable.

- **void scan()**:
  Initiates a scan for available WiFi networks and populates the `networks` vector with SSIDs found.

- **void stopVpn()**:
  Stops any currently running OpenVPN processes, logging relevant messages regarding the operation's success or failure.

- **void updateVpnPerformance(const std::string& file_path)**:
  Updates performance parameters in the VPN configuration specified by the `file_path`. This includes parameters like `tun-mtu`, `mssfix`, and `keepalive`.

- **void sedVpn(const std::string& file_path)**:
  Uses the `sed` command to modify a specific line (remote IP and port) in the VPN configuration file.

- **bool startVpn(const std::string& file_path)**:
  Initiates a VPN session using the specified file configuration, starting a listener thread to monitor the VPN process.

- **void vpnProcessListener(std::shared_ptr<std::promise<bool>> initPromise)**:
  A dedicated listener for parsing output from the VPN process to determine if initialization succeeded.

- **void disable_wifi()**:
  Disables the WiFi interface using `nmcli`.

- **void enable_wifi()**:
  Enables the WiFi interface using `nmcli`.

- **int check_wifi(const int _max_attempts = 30)**:
  Checks the WiFi connection status with a specified number of attempts. Returns status codes indicating connection state.

### Private Member Variables

- `std::string wireless_interface`: The name of the wireless interface being managed (e.g., "wlan0").
- `std::string current_network`: The SSID of the currently connected network.
- `std::string current_hostname`: The URI corresponding to the current network.
- `bool force_connection`: Indicates if the manager should forcibly attempt a connection.
- `bool _connected`: Flag indicating the current connection status.
- `bool _http_ok`: Indicates if HTTP connectivity has been established.
- `bool _vpn_ok`: Indicates if VPN connectivity has been established.
- `pid_t vpn_process`: The process ID for the VPN session.
- `std::shared_ptr<std::FILE*> vpn_output`: A shared pointer for managing the output stream of the VPN process.
- `std::thread vpn_listener_thread`: Thread responsible for listening to VPN process output.
- `std::vector<Connection> connections`: Vector of `Connection` objects representing known WiFi networks.
- `std::vector<std::string> networks`: Simple vector storing available network SSIDs.
- `Configuration& config`: Reference to an external configuration manager instance.
- `HTTPSession& session`: Reference to an external HTTP session handler.

### Private Member Functions

- **int isWlan0Connected(const std::string& statusOutput)**: Determines the connection status for the `wlan0` device based on its output status.

- **bool isConnected()**: Checks if the current wireless interface is connected to a network.

- **void tryConnect()**: Attempts to establish a connection to any of the known networks.

- **bool connect(const std::string& ssid, const std::string& password)**: Attempts to connect to a specified SSID using the provided password.

- **bool authenticationAndSetupProcedure()**: Handles the VPN authentication and setup process, including stopping any existing VPN, authenticating, and starting a new VPN session.

- **int runConnected()**: Checks the HTTP and VPN connection statuses and returns an integer code based on the results.

- **bool checkHttpAvailability(const std::string& hostname)**: Placeholder function to verify HTTP availability to a specific hostname.

- **std::string exec_command(const std::string& cmd)**: Helper function for executing shell commands and capturing their output.

### Error Handling and Logging

The `WiFiManager` class employs logging extensively throughout its methods, utilizing a logging utility (`Logger.h`) to capture detailed information about the operation, including success messages, errors, and exceptions.

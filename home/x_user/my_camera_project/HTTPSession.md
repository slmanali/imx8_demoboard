# HTTPSession Class Documentation

The `HTTPSession` class is a C++ class that provides functionalities to manage HTTP sessions for a system, particularly for interacting with an API related to helmets. This class includes methods for authentication, status checking, and data managementâ€”using HTTP requests to send and receive information in both JSON and binary formats using the `libcurl` library for handling the HTTP requests.

## Include Guards
```cpp
#ifndef HTTPSESSION_H
#define HTTPSESSION_H
```
This prevents multiple inclusions of the header guard.

## Header Files
- `<iostream>`: Basic input-output stream library for logging and error messages.
- `<string>`: Provides the `std::string` class for handling strings.
- `<random>`: For generating random numbers (e.g., for generating query parameters).
- `<chrono>`: Time utilities for measuring time durations.
- `<thread>`: Enables multi-threading functionalities such as sleep.
- `<fstream>`: File stream classes for file input and output.
- `<nlohmann/json.hpp>`: A header for parsing JSON data.
- `<curl/curl.h>`: A library for making HTTP requests.
- `"Logger.h"`: Custom logging class (assumed to be defined elsewhere).
- `<cstring>`: Provides C-style string manipulation functions.
- `<net/if.h>`, `<sys/ioctl.h>`, `<unistd.h>`: System headers for network operations and IO control.
- `"Timer.h"`: Custom timer class for timing operations.
- `"Configuration.h"`: Custom configuration class for handling configuration settings.
- `<atomic>`, `<filesystem>`, `<zip.h>`: Used for atomic operations, working with filesystem paths and ZIP file manipulation, respectively.
- `<sstream>`: Stream class that operates on strings, particularly for parsing.
- `<mutex>`: Provides a mutex class for thread synchronization.

## Class Definition
```cpp
class HTTPSession {
```

### Constructor
```cpp
HTTPSession(const std::string& api_url, const std::string& ssl_cert_path, const std::string& api_key, std::string _helmet_status, Configuration& config)
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `api_url`: URL to the API endpoint.
  - `ssl_cert_path`: Path to the SSL certificate for secure connections.
  - `api_key`: API key for authentication.
  - `_helmet_status`: Initial helmet status.
  - `config`: A reference to a `Configuration` object containing application configuration.

The constructor initializes various member variables and invokes `curl_global_init()` to initialize the libcurl library.

### Destructor
```cpp
~HTTPSession()
```
Cleans up resources by stopping timers and calling `curl_global_cleanup()`.

### Public Member Functions

#### Authentication
```cpp
bool authenticate()
```
Attempts to authenticate with the server by sending a ping and checking for success. It retries up to 5 times with a one-second interval.

#### Obtain Certificate
```cpp
void get_certificate(const std::string& certificate_file)
```
Downloads a certificate from the API and saves it to the specified file.

#### Record Client IP Address
```cpp
void record_ip(const std::string& client_address)
```
Records the client's IP address by sending it to the API.

#### Check HTTP Availability
```cpp
bool is_http_available(const std::string& host)
```
Checks whether the HTTP service is available by sending a GET request to a specified host.

#### Check VPN Availability
```cpp
bool is_vpn_available()
```
Checks whether a VPN service is available by sending a GET request to a specific hardcoded IP address.

#### Update API URL
```cpp
void update_api_url(const std::string& _api_url)
```
Updates the API URL used in the session.

#### Update Helmet Status
```cpp
void update_helmet_status(const std::string _helmet_status)
```
Updates the helmet status in a thread-safe manner using a mutex.

#### Get Helmet Status
```cpp
std::string get_helmet_status()
```
Returns the current helmet status in a thread-safe manner.

#### Update Operator Status
```cpp
void set_operator_status(std::string _operator_status)
```
Sets the operator status.

#### Notifications Management
```cpp
void generate_notify()
void stop_notify()
```
Starts and stops timers for notifying status changes.

#### Record Event
```cpp
void record_event(const std::string& cmd, const std::string& data)
```
Records an event by sending a command and data pair to the API.

#### Update Event
```cpp
void update_event(int idCallEvent, std::string key, std::string value)
```
Updates an event with a specific ID by sending a key-value pair to the API.

#### Request Wi-Fi List
```cpp
void request_wifi()
```
Requests a list of Wi-Fi networks from the API.

#### Request Support
```cpp
void request_support()
```
Requests technical support from the API.

#### Standalone Request
```cpp
void standalone_request()
```
Sends a request to get the status of the helmet while in standalone mode.

#### Terminate Support
```cpp
void terminate_support()
```
Terminates support by sending an appropriate request to the API.

#### Handle Tasks
```cpp
void handle_tasks_next()
void handle_tasks_back()
void handle_tasks_reset()
```
Mechanisms for sending task control commands to the API.

#### Check Standalone Mode
```cpp
int check_standalone()
```
Checks if the service is available and responds appropriately based on the status code.

#### Download Standalone Files
```cpp
void Download_standalone_FILES()
```
Downloads a ZIP file and extracts it to a predefined location.

### Private Member Functions
- Various private methods exist for making HTTP POST and GET requests, handling responses, setting system time, reading GPS and temperature, etc.

### Data Members
- `std::string api_url`: Holds the base URL for the API.
- `std::string ssl_cert_path`: Path for the SSL certificate.
- `std::string api_key`: API key for authentication.
- `std::string helmet_status`: Current helmet status.
- `Configuration& config`: A reference to configuration settings.
- Other members assist with managing status, responses, and utilities like timers and JSON handling.

### Static Callback Functions
There are several functions defined to manage response actions from the `libcurl` callbacks used for receiving data generated during HTTP requests.

### Exception Handling
The class consistently uses try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions, logging errors through the assumed `LOG_ERROR` and `LOG_INFO` methods provided by the `Logger` class.

### Additional Notes
The `HTTPSession` class encapsulates functionalities related to the helmet APIs and provides methods that follow a structured and consistent manner for interacting with the server. The extensive use of JSON for data transmission as well as thread-safe member functions suggests that it's designed for concurrent operations within a multi-threaded environment.
